# ESM3_tutorial

ESM3 is a frontier generative model for biology, able to jointly reason across three fundamental biological properties of proteins: sequence, structure, and function. These three data modalities are represented as tracks of discrete tokens at the input and output of ESM3. You can present the model with a combination of partial inputs across the tracks, and ESM3 will provide output predictions for all the tracks
